Scripts I use for making backups with rsnapshot.

# Install in /usr/local/sbin:
make install

# Find info
vgscan
vgdisplay

# Enable lv group
lvchange -a y skbak1

# Open using password
cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/skbak1/home bak-home

# Open using key file
cryptsetup open --type luks --key-file /home/skangas/huey-backup.luks /dev/skbak1/home bak-home

# Create a key file
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/root/.luks-backup-key

# Add it to logical volume
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/mapper/skbak1-home /root/.luks-backup-key
